Thus, the applicable portion of the body of the meteorological message states that for a 
trajectory whose maximum ordinate is 2000 meters, the ballistic wind is blowing from 
2800 mils at 22 knots, the ballistic air temperature is 94.9 percent of standard and the 
ballistic air density is 106.5 percent of standard.
B.
Ballistic Atmosphere.  As indicated above, each line of the body of the meteo-
rological message contains the ballistic wind, ballistic air temperature and ballistic air 
density for the indicated height.  When this height is zero, these quantities are the actual
wind, air temperature and air density at the MDP.  For other heights, there are certain 
effective mean values of the actual atmospheric structure, which are used in conjunction 
with the data given in the firing table to determine the effects of the actual atmospheric 
structure.  These mean values are computed, at the meteorological station, to apply to a 
trajectory having a maximum ordinate exactly equal to a particular standard height.  For 
firings where the maximum ordinate is not equal to one of the standard heights, it is suf-
ficient to use the ballistic wind, temperature and density computed for that standard 
height which is nearest to the maximum ordinate of the firing.
A projectile following a trajectory whose maximum ordinate is equal to some particular 
standard height passes through layers of the atmosphere where winds are blowing in var-
ious directions and at various speeds.  The ballistic wind for this standard height is that 
wind which is constant in speed and direction and which produces the same effect on the 
range, height and deflection of the projectile as the actual wind.
Definitions of ballistic air temperature and ballistic air density are essentially the same as 
that of ballistic wind, but differ in that there are, in these cases, no deflection effects. 
Trajectories for standard conditions are computed for an atmospheric structure in which 
the air temperature and air density decrease with increasing height according to the laws 
defining the ICAO Standard Atmosphere (U. S. Standard Atmosphere, 1962).  The ratio 
of the actual air temperature to the standard air temperature, expressed as a percentage, is 
called the relative air temperature.  Corresponding to any actual temperature structure, 
there is a hypothetical temperature structure for which the relative air temperature is con-
stant at all heights and which has the same effect on range as the actual structure.  This 
constant relative air temperature is called the ballistic air temperature.  Similarly, the ratio 
of the actual air density to the standard air density, expressed as a percentage, is called 
the relative air density.  Corresponding to any actual density structure, there is a hypo-
thetical density structure for which the relative air density is constant at all heights and 
which has the same effect on range as the actual structure.  This constant relative air den-
sity is called the ballistic air density.
