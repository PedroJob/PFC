Air Density 1 Pct (Range Corrections for a Decrease (In-
crease) of 1 Percent in Air Density).  Standard air density at 
sea level is 1225.0 grams per cubic meter.  Standard air 
densities at finite heights above sea level have been estab-
lished as part of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere (U.S. 
Standard Atmosphere, 1962).  Air density at any given 
height is recorded and transmitted as a percent of the stan-
dard absolute density for that height.  Air density affects 
the drag exerted upon the projectile.  Therefore, changes in 
air density will change the drag and consequently the range.

Proj Wt of 1 Sq (4 Sq Std) (Range Corrections for a De-
crease (Increase) of 1 Square in Projectile Weight).  The 
standard projectile weight for this table is 103.5 pounds. 
Correction should be made for difference in projectile 
weight as indicated by the number of squares.  A decrease 
in projectile weight increases the muzzle velocity, the ef-
fect of which is to lengthen the range.  But it also decreases 
the ballistic coefficient, the effect of which is to shorten the 
range.  The combined effect may be either an increase or a 
decrease in range depending upon which individual effect 
is predominant.  Under certain conditions these two effects 
tend to cancel each other.

Probable Errors – These probable errors were computed 
from uncorrected firing data obtained from all available 
sources and are estimates of the average probable errors. 
On a given occasion the observed probable error may be 
greater or less than the average probable error in accor-
dance with the laws of probability.  The probable errors in-
dicate the round-to-round variation of a single piece fired 
on a single occasion and do not reflect the variation of the 
mean of either a single piece fired on different occasions or 
different pieces fired on the same occasion.
