Table
C 
Components of a One Knot Wind  A wind of one knot, blowing from the 
chart direction, divided into two components; the cross wind, perpendicu-
lar to the plane of fire, and the range wind, parallel to the plane of fire.  
These components are to be multiplied by the wind speed from the appro-
priate line of the met message to obtain the total cross and range wind to 
be used in the particular fire problem. 
D 
Air Temperature and Density Corrections – Corrections added to the bal-
listic air temperature and the ballistic air density to compensate for the dif-
ference in altitude between the firing battery and the meteorological sta-
tion.
E 
Effects on Muzzle Velocity Due to Propellant Temperature – The changes 
in muzzle velocity produced by variations in the propellant temperature. 
Whenever possible, the temperature of the propellant itself should be 
measured, rather than assuming that it is the same as the air temperature. 
The velocity effect obtained from this table is converted to a range correc-
tion by use of column 10 or 11 in Table F.
F 
Basic Data and Correction Factors – A compilation of the basic data 
required for the solution of the gunnery problem.  The data are arranged in 
19 columns, each column of which is a function of the listed range.  Since 
all of these quantities have been computed for a target at the level point, 
Table F applies primarily to targets at the same altitude as the gun.  Suffi-
cient information may be found to produce a graze burst on a target at the 
level point.  For targets above or below the level point, Table F is entered 
with a range first determined from Table B.
Following is an explanation of the content of each column of Table F.
Column
1–9 
Basic Data
1
Range – The distance, measured on the surface of a sphere con-
centric with the earth, from the muzzle to a target at the level 
point.
2 
Elev (Elevation) – The angle of the gun in the vertical plane re-
quired to reach the range tabulated in column 1.  The maximum 
elevation shown represents the highest angle at which predictable 
projectile flight is possible under standard conditions of met and 
materiel.  This number varies with nonstandard conditions of met 
and materiel and is particularly sensitive to changes in range 
wind.  Some of the elevations listed may exceed the maximum 
weapon elevation, but they can be achieved through modification 
of the weapon position.
