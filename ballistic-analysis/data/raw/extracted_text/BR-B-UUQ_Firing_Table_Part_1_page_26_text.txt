Thus, the introduction to the sample message indicates that it is a ballistic meteorological 
message applicable to surface fire in octant 1 of the globe.  Specifically, it is applicable to 
an area whose center is latitude 34.4 degrees north and whose longitude is 98.3 degrees 
west.  The message is valid on the 12th of the month starting at 1430 Greenwich Mean 
Time.  The atmospheric pressure at the MDP, which is 370 meters above mean sea level, 
is 101.3 percent of standard at sea level.

Body of the Message.  All 16 lines of the body of the message have the
same form.  The initial line is identified by the first pair of digits (00) and deals with 
surface meteorological conditions.  Each subsequent line furnishes information applicable 
to firings for which the maximum ordinate of the trajectory is equal to the standard height 
associated with the first pair of digits of the line.  These two digits are the line number 
indicating the standard height relative to the MDP.

Because all of the lines in the body of the message have the same form, a detailed expla-
nation of one line will serve as a sample for any line.  Assume that the appropriate line 
number is 05.
