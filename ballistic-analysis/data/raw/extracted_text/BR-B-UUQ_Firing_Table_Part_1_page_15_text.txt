(U) Explanation of Tables
Firing tables contain data based on standard and nonstandard trajectories for a 
given weapon and combination of projectile, fuze and propelling charge.  A standard 
trajectory fired at a given elevation is one theoretically existing under arbitrarily chosen 
conditions of weather and materiel.  A nonstandard trajectory is one existing under 
conditions of weather and materiel differing from the arbitrarily chosen standard 
conditions.  Standard firing data and the corrections needed to compensate for significant 
variations from standard conditions may be determined from the firing tables.  The 
following variations from standard conditions were used in preparing the firing tables.
Muzzle Velocity (decrease and increase)
10 m/s
Range Wind (head and tail)
50 knots
Cross Wind (left and right)
50 knots
Ballistic Air Temperature (decrease and increase)
10 percent
Ballistic Air Density (decrease and increase)
10 percent
Projectile Weight (decrease and increase)
1 square
Angle of Site (+ site and - site)
50 mils
The ranges in the tables are distances along the surface of a sphere concentric with the 
earth and passing through the muzzle of the tube.  The point at which the descending 
branch of the trajectory intersects this concentric sphere is designated the level point.  
Targets at zero height are at the level point.  Other targets are considered to be directly 
above or below the level point.
In general, plus signs are omitted from these tables.  Therefore, numbers without signs 
are to be considered positive.  Negative quantities are shown with a minus sign.

The contents of these tables are described below.
Table
A  
Line Number of Meteorological Message  Digits which represent prese-
lected standard heights. The height zones represented by the line numbers 
are given as a function of quadrant elevation.  If quadrant elevation is 
known, or can be reasonably inferred, Table A should be used for line 
number.  Otherwise, line number may be obtained from Table B as a func-
tion of range and height of target above gun.
B  
Complementary Range Line Number  Range corrections corresponding 
to the complementary angle of site, and line numbers of the meteorologi-
cal message.  The range corrections are tabulated as a function of range 
and height of target above the gun.  For a target at some height other than 
zero, the complementary range correction is added to the chart range to 
obtain a range to be used for entering Table F.  The line number is tabu-
lated in the margins of the table.  Each particular line number is applicable 
to all target points lying between the heavy dividing lines containing that 
number.
