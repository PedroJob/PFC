Corrections to Temperature and Density.  As stated, the heights referred to in
the preceding discussion are heights above the MDP, which is the horizontal plane con-
taining the meteorological station.  Ballistic air temperature and ballistic air density must 
be corrected for the difference in altitude between the battery and the MDP.  The neces-
sary corrections are contained in Table D, Temperature and Density Corrections.  The 
ballistic wind, however, is not corrected for the difference in altitude of the battery and 
MDP because, unlike air temperature and air density, wind does not follow a predictable 
variation with height.
D.
Types of Meteorological Message.  Currently, two types of met messages
(identified as 2 or 3) are in use.  Each is adapted to a certain large class of guns and am-
munition.  The type 2 message is for surface-to-air firing, and the type 3 message is for 
surface-to-surface firing.  For this firing table use type 3 message at all elevations of all 
charges.
