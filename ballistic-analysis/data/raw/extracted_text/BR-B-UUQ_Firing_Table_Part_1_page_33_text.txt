Explanation of Probability Table
A.
The probability table consists of an argument, T, for entering the table and a
body of figures representing areas under the normal probability curve.
B.
The first vertical column gives the value of T for entry to the nearest one-tenth
of a probable error (PE).  The top horizontal line permits entry using a value of T ex-
pressed to the nearest one-hundredth.
Example 1.
It is desired to locate the area under the normal curve that corres-
ponds to 1.4 probable errors.  Locate 1.4 in the first vertical column.  Since the required 
number of probable errors is expressed only to the nearest one-tenth, read the answer 
.3275 in the horizontal column headed 0.00.  Had the value of T been expressed as 1.44, 
the answer would appear as .3343 in the column headed 0.04.
C.
The figures in the body of the table represent areas under the normal probabili-
ty curve.  The entire area under this curve is assumed to be 1.  Therefore, the probability 
that an event will occur within the given limits is represented by some corresponding area 
under the curve.  Thus, the probability that an artillery round will fall somewhere be-
tween the true center of impact and a point one probable error beyond this center is 
represented by the hatched area in the figure below. This area, compared to the total area 
under the curve, is one fourth or 0.25.
Therefore, each decimal fraction in the body of the table expresses the probability that the 
deviation, in one direction only, of the point of impact of a projectile from an adjusting 
point will not be greater than T probable errors.
Example 2.
An artillery piece registers upon an adjusting point.  The probable 
error is 30 meters.  One round is fired under the adjusted conditions.  The probability that 
this round will fall beyond the adjusting point, a distance not to exceed 30 meters, is de-
termined as follows.  One probable error is equal to 30 meters.  Enter the table using a 
value of T equal to 1.0.  In the column headed 0.00 the probability is found to be 0.2500 
for an impact beyond the target (over) not to exceed 30 meters.  The same probability 
would be read for an impact short of the target (short) not to exceed 30 meters.  The 
probability of a round falling on either side of the adjusting point within 30 meters cannot
