Explanation of Components of a One Knot Wind
The table of components of a one knot wind, Table C, resolves a wind of one knot, blow-
ing from any chart direction, into its cross wind and range wind components.  Chart di-
rection is the azimuth of the wind direction (increased by 6400 when necessary) minus 
the azimuth of the direction of fire.  There are two distinct problems which are solved 
with Table C.  These are outlined below.
A.
Azimuth Correction for Ballistic Wind.  Enter column 1 of Table C with the
applicable chart direction and obtain from column 2 a cross wind component.  This com-
ponent will be preceded by an R or an L.  The product of the observed wind, the compo-
nent just determined, and the correction factor from column 9 of Table F is the azimuth 
correction to compensate for the ballistic wind.  This correction is applied to the right if 
the component is preceded by an R, to the left, if by an L.
B.
Range Correction for Ballistic Wind.  Enter column 1 of Table C with the ap-
plicable chart direction and obtain from column 3 a range wind component.  This compo-
nent will be preceded by an H or a T.  If the wind component is preceded by an H, enter 
column 12 of Table F to obtain the correction factor; if by a T, enter column 13.  The 
product of the observed wind, the component just obtained, and the correction factor 
from Table F is the correction to range to compensate for the ballistic wind.
