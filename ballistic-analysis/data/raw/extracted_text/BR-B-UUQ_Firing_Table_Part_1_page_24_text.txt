(U) Explanation of Meteorological Message
A. Composition of Meteorological Message.  The ballistic met message as de-
scribed in STANAG 4061 (Edition No. 3), 19 May 1969, is divided into two
parts – the introduction containing, primarily, identification information and
the body of the message containing meteorological information.  The intro-
duction consists of two lines broken into four groups of letters and numbers
and the body of the message consists of a sequence of up to sixteen lines, each
broken into two groups of six digit numbers.  The various parts of a met mes-
sage are explained as follows:
