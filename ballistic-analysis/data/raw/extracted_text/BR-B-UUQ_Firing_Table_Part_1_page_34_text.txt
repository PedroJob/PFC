be read directly in the table.  To express this condition, the probability for an over must 
be added to the probability for a short. In the previous example, this probability would be 
0.5000.
D.
The probability of a round falling within any given distance of the target can be
found in the table by first converting the given distance to probable errors.
 
Example 3.
With a probable error of 30 meters the probability that a single 
round will be over and will fall within 49 meters of the target is determined as follows: 
49 meters equals 1.63 probable errors.  Reading directly from the table the probability is 
0.3642.
E.
The Probability Table permits the calculation of the probability of a round  fall-
ing within limits that do not include the adjusting point.
 
Example 4.
Given a probable error of 26 meters, the probability of a round 
falling between 26 and 35 meters over the adjusting point is determined as follows:  26 
meters equals 1.00 PE, 35 meters equals 1.35 PE.  The probability of the round falling 
over the adjusting point a distance of 35 meters or less is 0.3187.  The probability of the 
round falling over the adjusting point a distance of 26 meters or less is 0.2500.  To find 
the probability of the round falling between the given limits, subtract 0.2500 from 
0.3187.  The result is a probability of 0.0687.
F.
The values in the table may be interpolated using direct proportion.
Example 5.
The probability that a round will fall short within a distance of
1.503 probable errors from the adjusting point is determined as follows.  The probability 
corresponding to 1.50 equals 0.3442, and corresponding to 1.51 equals 0.3458.  The 
probability for 1.503 PE occurs three-tenths of the way between 0.3442 and 0.3458, and 
therefore equals 0.3447.
