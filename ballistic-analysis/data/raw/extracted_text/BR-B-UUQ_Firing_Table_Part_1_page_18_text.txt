Range Correction Factors – Corrections to range to com-
pensate for the effects of nonstandard conditions. Although 
the corrections given in columns 10 through 19 are tabu-
lated for a unit decrease and a unit increase in the nonstan-
dard conditions, they are actually mean values based on an 
expected decrease and increase in the nonstandard condi-
tions.  The columns of corrections for an increase in the 
nonstandard conditions are shaded to aid in identification. 
A tail wind is considered to be an increase in wind for this 
purpose.
10-11
Muzzle Velocity 1 M/S (Range Corrections for a Decrease 
(Increase) of One Meter per Second in Muzzle Velocity) – 
Corrections to range to compensate for variations from the 
standard muzzle velocity that appears on the title page for 
each charge.
12-13
Range Wind 1 Knot (Range Corrections for a Head Wind 
(Tail Wind) of 1 Knot). In computing a standard trajectory 
it is assumed that no wind is blowing.  In the wind compo-
nent's table, Table C, a head wind is designated by the 
symbol H and a tail wind, by T.  If the symbol is H, enter 
column 12 and if T, enter column 13.
14-15 
Air Temp 1 Pct (Range Corrections for a Decrease (In-
crease) of One Percent in Air Temperature).  Standard air 
temperature at sea level is 15.0 degrees Centigrade (59.0° 
F).   On the absolute scale, the equivalent temperature is 
288.2 degrees Kelvin.   Standard air temperatures at finite 
heights above sea level have been established as part of the 
ICAO standard atmosphere (U.S. standard atmosphere, 
1962).  Temperature at any given height is recorded and 
transmitted as a percent of the standard absolute tempera-
ture for that height.   The drag that a projectile encounters 
is a function of Mach number (ratio of the velocity of the 
projectile to the velocity of sound).  The drag varies appre-
ciably with Mach number, particularly near Mach one 
where the velocity of the projectile and the velocity of 
sound are equal. Since the velocity of sound is a function of 
air temperature, it follows that changes in air temperature 
will change the Mach number, thereby changing the drag 
and consequently the range.   This effect is sometimes 
called the elasticity effect.  It should not be confused with 
the distinctly separate effect which air temperature produc-
es through its influence on air density.
