FS for Graze Burst  Numbers to be set on fuzes MTSQ, M582 
and ET, M767 that will produce a graze burst at the level point 
when firing under standard conditions.  This setting will produce 
a graze burst at the time of flight listed in column 7.
4
DFS per 10 M Dec (Change in Fuze Setting for 10 Meters De-
crease in Height of Burst)  The adjustment to fuze setting re-
quired to decrease the height of burst 10 meters.  To increase the 
height of burst 10 meters, change the sign of the value given in 
the table.
5
DR per 1 Mil D Elev (Change in Range for One Mil Change in 
Elevation) – Adjustment in range corresponding to a one mil 
change in the angle of elevation.
6
Fork  The change in the angle of elevation necessary to produce 
a change in range at the level point equivalent to four probable 
errors in range.
7
Time of Flight – The projectile travel time, under standard condi-
tions, from the muzzle to the level point at the range in column 1.  
Time of flight is used as fuze setting for the following  fuzes: 
MTSQ, M582 and ET, M767.
8-9 Azimuth Corrections  The angular changes in the horizontal
plane necessary to compensate for a departure of the projectile 
from the vertical plane of fire.  Any deviation of   the projectile 
from the vertical plane of fire is considered a deflection effect. 
The corrections tabulated in columns 8 and 9 are used in deter-
mining the change in traverse angle needed to offset the effects 
of drift and cross wind, two of the phenomena that create a def-
lection effect.  Although drift exists in a standard trajectory, it is 
assumed, for simplicity, to be a deflection effect.
8
Drift (Corr to L)  (Azimuth Corrections to Compensate for 
Drift)  Because of the right hand twist of the tube, the drift of 
the projectile is to the right of the vertical plane of fire.  This drift 
must be compensated for by a correction to the left.
9
CW of 1 Knot  (Azimuth Corrections to Compensate for a 
Cross Wind of 1 Knot)  Ballistic cross wind components may 
be from either the right or the left, and the weapon must be tra-
versed into the cross wind to compensate for the deflection effect 
 to the right for a cross wind blowing from the right of the plane 
of fire, to the left for a cross wind blowing from the left.  In the
