Cot Angle of Fall (Cotangent of Angle of Fall) – The trigo-
nometric function of the angle of fall given in column 8.
10
TML VEL (Terminal Velocity) – The speed of the projec-
tile at the level point.
11
MO (Maximum Ordinate) – The maximum height above 
the gun of the trajectory fired, under standard conditions, to 
the range in column 1.
12-13
Comp Site for Angle of Site (Complementary Angle of Site 
for Each Mil Angle of Site)  The correction which must 
be added algebraically to each mil of actual angle of site to 
compensate for the nonrigidity of the trajectory.  Use col-
umn 12 when the target is above the gun in altitude, column 
13 when the target is below the gun.
H 
Rotation – Range (Corrections to Range, in Meters, to Compensate for the 
Rotation of the Earth)  Range corrections required to offset the effects on 
range produced by the rotation of the earth.
I 
Rotation – Azimuth (Corrections to Azimuth, in Mils, to Compensate for 
the Rotation of the Earth)  Azimuth corrections required to offset the ef-
fects on deflection produced by the rotation of the earth.
J 
Fuze Correction Factors  Corrections to fuze setting to compensate for 
the effects of nonstandard conditions.  The data are arranged in 11 col-
umns, each of which gives values for the various quantities as a function 
of the fuze setting tabulated in the first column.  Since all of these quanti-
ties have been computed for a target at the level point, Table J applies 
primarily to targets at the same altitude as the gun.  Sufficient information 
may be found to produce a graze burst on a target at the level point.  For 
targets above or below the level point, Table J is entered with a fuze set-
ting determined from Table F. The exact procedure to follow for either 
case is explained in the examples of problems in paragraph 11.  Although 
the corrections given in columns 2 through 11 are tabulated for a unit de-
crease and a unit increase in the nonstandard conditions, they are actually 
mean values based on an expected decrease and increase in the nonstan-
dard conditions.  A tail wind is considered to be an increase in wind for 
this purpose.
Following is a listing of the contents of Table J.  For a detailed explana-
tion of columns 2 through 11, see the explanation of columns 10 through 
19 in Table F.  In these explanations, substitute fuze corrections for range 
corrections.
