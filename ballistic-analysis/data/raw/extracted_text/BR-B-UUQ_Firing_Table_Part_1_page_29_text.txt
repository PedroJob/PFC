10. (U) Problem
A.
General.  Firing tables contain the data needed to determine the quadrant eleva- 
tion and deflection that will produce detonation of the projectile at the target when firing 
under all conditions of weather and materiel.  In the field, graphical equipment is utilized 
in conjunction with these tables to increase the speed of fire.  The sample problem in 
paragraph 11 illustrates the numerical solution of the fire problem and thus does not in-
corporate the use of graphical equipment.
B.
Arithmetic Precision.  In the computation of the problem that follows, certain
rules and principles affecting the arithmetic precision of the solution are stated or im-
plied.  These are guidelines only.  Greater arithmetic precision could be achieved by more 
stringent rules.  However, the improvement in the effectiveness of fire would generally 
be negligible and certainly not justify the added complexity.  The following list presents 
various rules and principles affecting the arithmetic precision.
x 
Interpolation in a given table cannot result in a value with more de-
cimal places than the values listed in that table.
x 
Chart range to a target is normally determined to the nearest 10 me-
ters and chart direction (deflection) to the nearest mil.
x 
The NATO met message describes wind to the nearest 100 mils of di-
rection and to the nearest 1 knot of speed.  Computed values of the 
chart direction of the wind, and the range and cross wind compo-
nents, should be expressed to the nearest 100 mils and to the nearest 
knot.
x 
The expression and application of a velocity variation from standard 
should be to the nearest tenth of a meter per second.
C.
Round-off Rules
(1)
General.  When rounding off to the nearest whole number, round to the
nearest even number when the value ends in 0.5; when rounding to the nearest tenth, 
round to the nearest even tenth when the value ends in 0.05.  This same principle applies 
to rounding off to the nearest ten and to the nearest hundred.  Round-off in the sample 
problem is expressed by .
