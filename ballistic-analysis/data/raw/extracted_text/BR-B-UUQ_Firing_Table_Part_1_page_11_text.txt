FOOTNOTES 
(d)
(U//FOUO) Cannon, M284 has a dual condemnation criteria of 2650 EFC (fatigue)
rounds or 0.105 inches wear (6.205 inches bore diameter) taken at 41.75 inches forward of
the rear face of the tube, whichever comes first.

(U) Fatigue
The process of metal fatigue is caused by the repeated application of firing pressures or 
high stresses from various charges and sustained tube temperatures.  Each round of am-
munition fired through a cannon reduces tube life due to metal degradation.
For cannon tubes condemned based on metal fatigue, the effective full charge rounds 
fired will be used to determine remaining tube life and will be used as the foremost criteria 
in condemnation.  However, all tubes should be constantly checked and possibly con-
demned based on the presence of cracks, defects and other damage which make the can-
non unsafe to fire (as determined from borescope, comparison checks and visual inspec-
tion).  Detailed information on fatigue and tube condemnation is contained in TM 
9-1000-202-14.  This applies to the following cannons: 
 M284 
. 
7.
(U) Erosion
The process of erosion removes metal from the bore surface of a cannon by the move-
ment of hot gases and residues generated from the burning of the propellant as well as by the 
passing of the projectile through the bore.  Detailed information on erosion is contained in 
TM 9-1000-202-14.
For tubes exhibiting uniform wear, the loss in muzzle velocity may be estimated from 
measurements taken in accordance with instructions given in the publication referred to 
above.  For tubes exhibiting irregular wear, as evidenced principally by stripped lands, the 
loss in muzzle velocity cannot be estimated reliably from wear measurements.  The latter 
tubes will continue to fire accurately but their velocity levels should be inferred from 
registration firings or determined using a muzzle velocity measuring device.
